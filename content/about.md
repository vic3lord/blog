Or is an experienced SRE for over a decade, building companies and their infrastructure.
Responsible for educating engineers working with cloud-native platforms on best-practices,
helping them be the best and most efficient they can be in order to provide value with least friction.
Designing highly scalable platforms that serve billions of requests and happy customers with resiliency and simplicity in mind.

Manifesting systems and bringing them to life with the best in class technology-stack that fits the needs of the business.
Whether it be Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform, AWS, Go, Prometheus, Temporal etc.
Writing packages alongside developers to help them abstract the complexity away from servers they build
such as gRPC and Pub/Sub with developer-experience in mind.

Leading the compliance processes (SOC2, ISO, PCI, HIPAA etc.) with implementing security guidelines and guardrails altogether
with education and presentations preventing bad practices to reoccur in the future.

Striving for data-driven organizations Or also designed the BI and data engineering practices, data-pipelines, dashboards
and tools helping organizations emitting data to lakes and warehouses by providing libraries and SDKs to interact with massive data needs.
> Pipelines written in Apache-beam, dashboards with Apache Superset or Metabase, headless BI for frontends and other needs implemented with cube.dev

Creating and advocating for advanced methodologies together with developers to have common ground between SRE and devs 
to have great DevOps culture and to have them impact their daily work.
- CI/CD with progressive rollouts and canaries (Flagger).
- Feature flags and A/B testing.
- GitOps (Flux).
- Ownership of teams and on-call shifts (you build it, you run it).
- Postmortem framework with emphasis on being blameless in order to learn and set up prevention for the future.
- ChatOps and chatbots that help devs debug and understand the system without the need of installing tools/scripts by providing a lot of the tasks as a Slack bot to interact with many daily tedious tasks that are automated via simple commands.

Contributing to the open-source community for tools we use and love.
Publishing internal tools as open-source when it's clear it has more general use cases outside of the company and can make the community's lives easier.
